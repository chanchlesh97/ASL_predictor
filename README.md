# ASL_predictor
This project provides a machine learning model to make prediction of American Sign Language using MobileNetV2 to bridge the gap of
understanding between a vocally challenged person and a naive person who doesn't know the ASL(American Sign Language).

Performance of different model are compared. MobileNetV2 turned out to be the best for a real-time such as conversation.
